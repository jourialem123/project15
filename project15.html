    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <div class="container bg-success">Baking</div><br>
    <img id="san" src="san.jpeg">
    <div class="container border-start border-success">Baking is one of my favorite hobbies because I get to experiment with different flavors, and try extraordinary combinations, to get a unique and delicious dish that I have never tried before. Like when I made a burnt basque cheese cake with lemons and drizzled nutella on top.</div><br>
  
    <div class="container bg-primary">Coding</div><br>
    <img src="code.jpeg" id="code" >
<div class="container border-start border-primary">Coding is also one of my best activities since I can create beautiful and creative websites like this one. I have been learning this essential skill for 8 weeks, and I hope I can master it someday. </div><br>
<div class="container bg-info">Swimming</div>
<img src="swim.webp" id="swim">
<div class="container border-start border-info">I have always loved swimming whether it was at the beach or at a swimming pool. My father first taught me when I was 12 and I have been improving ever since. Although this sport is crucial to know, I can not practice it often since it gets cold in the winter.</div>
